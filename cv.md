## About me 
---
By my first education I am a specialist in international relations, but at some point in my life I realized that I like programming. So now I'm a self-taught Web Developer specialized in JavaScript. I have done several projects. You can see them on my [Github account](https://github.com/VovaK1). I like this direction and want to continue to study and improve my knowledge.
